# 1. Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end audit analytics dashboard built in Power BI using Accounts Payable and transaction-level invoice data.
The dashboard was designed to visualise Purchase to Pay transactions and hence to aid audit procedures commonly performed, including:
- Cut-off testing
- Aging analysis
- Unusual items review
- High-value transaction analysis
- Drill-through transaction inspection

The objective of the project was to demonstrate how I use Power BI to enhance audit efficiency and financial analysis through interactive data visualisation.

# 2. Business Problem
During external audits, auditors often manually inspect transactions around year-end, overdue payables, unusual balances, and high-risk invoices. This process is typically spreadsheet-driven and time-consuming.

This dashboard transforms these audit procedures into an interactive analytics solution that allows users to:
- dynamically adjust cut-off periods,
- change materiality thresholds,
- investigate transactions,
- and drill into invoice-level details.

By including the interactive elements, I have made it flexible to be catered to each specific client with different materiality levels.


# 3. Dashboard Features

1. Dynamic Cut-Off Testing

Interactive Features:
- Cut-off days selector
- Threshold slicer

Users can:
- Adjust cut-off window (X days before/after year-end) and select the desired threshold,
- Analyse transaction volumes around YE,
- Identify high-value transactions above threshold (highlighted automatically) near YE.
- Analyse transaction trend
- Analyse transaction amounts by vendor via the scatter chart
- Drill-through to Transaction Details directly

2. Accounts Payable Aging Analysis

The dashboard includes:
- aging bucket analysis,
- vendor-level aging review,
- overdue invoice tracking.

Users are able to drill-through to all the accounts payable to any supplier and to the summary of all the invoices in a certain age bucket.

# 4. Data Model

The project integrates:
- Accounts Payable listing
- Transaction listing
- Date dimension table

Relationships were established using:
- Invoice IDs
- Vendor names
- Date dimensions
